# Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
#
# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
# Example 3:
#
# Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
# Output: 1
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
# -109 <= Node.val <= 109
# All Node.val are unique.
# p != q
# p and q will exist in the tree.
